It seems all coins run a certain course:
1: start low, peak early and then fall to nothing
2: start high, drop to nothing and then peak some time in the future (sometimes months later)

Coins may also get a little boost if links are added.
 - ie in the case of linx, an announcement link was added and the coin rose by about 300%
after remaining flat for quite some time (about 2 weeks)
 - Should be able to take advantage of this


 By far the best method for now is to get in early for new coins,
 Almost every coin that starts @ around 10sats or less with make a good peak
